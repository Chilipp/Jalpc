    During my Bachelor I realized that I really want to do research on
    how our world is evolving. This wish was even stronger than my joy about
    the beauty of maths in physics. I have strong theoretical skills so I
    started coding and to develop climate models. This is now the way to go for
    me and since then I rejoice in data analysis and visualization. We can
    extract so much new knowledge out of these large data sets through visual
    and statistical exploration. Hence I am always keen to learn and develop
    new techniques and to share them with others.
