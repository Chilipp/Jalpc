  long_desc: |
    The Helmholtz Coastal Data Center (HCDC) is the central point of contact
    for scientific data management at the Institute of Coastal Research. The
    new central working group possesses broad expertise and consists of
    geoscientists, programmers and web developers as well as database and
    metadata managers. One aim of the unit is to merge data from coastal and
    marine research with the help of a central data portal and to provide
    sustainable access to different user groups. HCDC therefore equally
    addresses the scientific field, the interested public and decision makers
    who manage coastal regions and the marine environment.

  desc: Holocene Climate Reconstruction for the Northern Hemisphere Extra-tropics
  long_desc: |
    A key scientific objective of this SNF funded project is using data to
    identify the relative contribution of the summer and winter seasons to
    Northern Hemisphere interglacial warming, and particularly the relative
    role of an orbitally driven increase in insolation in summer, and a
    dynamically driven increase in the pole-ward heat flux in winter. We
    investigate the role of atmospheric dynamics by comparison with comparable
    patterns of regional climate anomalies generated by modern analogue
    circulation patterns. The project will make available a high quality
    gridded and seasonally resolved reconstruction of Northern Hemisphere
    climate change during the Holocene that will provide a state-of-the-art
    baseline for climate model evaluation, and particularly to evaluate the
    ability of models to reproduce regional climate change, which remains a key
    uncertainty in simulations of future climate change.

  desc: Python framework for interactive data visualization
  long_desc: |
    psyplot is a cross-platform open source python project that mainly
    combines the plotting utilities of matplotlib and the data
    management of the xarray package and integrates them into a
    software that can be used via command-line and via a GUI. It forms the basis for many of my data analysis tasks.
    <br>
    The main purpose is to have a framework that allows a fast, attractive,
    flexible, easily applicable, easily reproducible and especially an interactive
    visualization and analysis of data.
    <br>
    Through various plugins psyplot visualizes georeferenced climate model data
    on rectangular and unstructured grids, regressions, stratigraphic diagrams
    and more. The plugins are:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://psyplot.readthedocs.io/projects/psy-simple">psy-simple</a> for simple visualizations</li>
    <li><a href="https://psyplot.readthedocs.io/projects/psy-maps">psy-maps</a> for visualizations of georeferenced data</li>
    <li><a href="https://psyplot.readthedocs.io/projects/psy-reg">psy-reg</a> for the visualization of statistical fits</li>
    <li><a href="https://psyplot.readthedocs.io/projects/psyplot-gui">psyplot-gui</a> for a graphical user interface</li>
    <li><a href="https://psy-strat.readthedocs.io">psy-strat</a> for the visualization of stratigraphic data, such as pollen diagrams</li>

  desc: A software for a semi-automatic digitization of pollen diagrams or other types of stratigraphic diagrams using the command line or a graphical user interface.
  long_desc: |
    STRADITIZE (Stratigraphic Diagram Digitizer) is an open-source program that
    allows stratigraphic figures to be digitized in a single semi-automated
    operation. It is designed to detect multiple plots of variables analyzed along
    the same vertical axis, whether this is a sediment core or any similar
    depth/time series.
