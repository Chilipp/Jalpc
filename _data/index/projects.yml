  long_desc: |
    The Helmholtz Coastal Data Center (HCDC) is the central point of contact
    for scientific data management at the Institute of Coastal Research. The
    new central working group possesses broad expertise and consists of
    geoscientists, programmers and web developers as well as database and
    metadata managers. One aim of the unit is to merge data from coastal and
    marine research with the help of a central data portal and to provide
    sustainable access to different user groups. HCDC therefore equally
    addresses the scientific field, the interested public and decision makers
    who manage coastal regions and the marine environment.

  desc: Python framework for interactive data visualization
  long_desc: |
    psyplot is a cross-platform open source python project that mainly
    combines the plotting utilities of matplotlib and the data
    management of the xarray package and integrates them into a
    software that can be used via command-line and via a GUI. It forms the basis for many of my data analysis tasks.
    <br>
    The main purpose is to have a framework that allows a fast, attractive,
    flexible, easily applicable, easily reproducible and especially an interactive
    visualization and analysis of data.
    <br>
    Through various plugins psyplot visualizes georeferenced climate model data
    on rectangular and unstructured grids, regressions, stratigraphic diagrams
    and more. The plugins are:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://psyplot.github.io/psy-simple">psy-simple</a> for simple visualizations</li>
    <li><a href="https://psyplot.github.io/psy-maps">psy-maps</a> for visualizations of georeferenced data</li>
    <li><a href="https://psyplot.github.io/psy-reg">psy-reg</a> for the visualization of statistical fits</li>
    <li><a href="https://psyplot.github.io/psyplot-gui">psyplot-gui</a> for a graphical user interface</li>
    <li><a href="https://psy-strat.readthedocs.io">psy-strat</a> for the visualization of stratigraphic data, such as pollen diagrams</li>
    </ul>

  desc: Web portal to manage and collaborate within an academic community
  long_desc: |
    Collaboration Platforms for harmonization and building a shared understanding
    of communities are essential components in today's academic environment.
    With the help of modern software tools and advancing digitization, our
    communities can improve collaboration via event, project and file
    management, and communication. The variety of tasks and tools needed in
    interdisciplinary communities, however, pose a considerable obstacle for
    community members.

    We see them in the administration, and especially when on-boarding new
    members with different levels of experience (from student to senior
    scientist). Here, user-friendly, technical support is needed. We are
    involved in many communities, particularly in the Climate Limited-area
    Modelling Community (CLM-Community) and the Helmholtz Metadata
    Collaboration (HMC). With the input of these (and more) communities, I
    developed the DJAC-Platform, an open-source, Python
    (Django)-based website. DJAC manages communities from a single institute to
    an (inter-)national community with hundreds and more participating research
    institutions.

  desc: Software templates and Helm Charts for secure and sustainable deployment via Kubernetes
  long_desc: |
    Web applications have become increasingly vital in scientific settings,
    facilitating knowledge transfer, collaboration, and data publication.
    Establishing a secure IT infrastructure to accommodate a diverse range of
    web applications and technologies however poses significant challenges.
    Addressing this issue, I developed a secure yet adaptable approach to deploy
    and maintain multiple web applications.

    The concept leverages Kubernetes
    OpenShift, employing a standardized, git-centric workflow to document web
    applications, responsibilities, and technologies. Security measures include
    regular image updates, micro-segmentation, and least privilege roles. The
    concept embraces reproducibility and division of labor through the
    utilization of cookiecutter templates, Helm charts, and Ansible. It
    incorporates essential concepts such as CI/CD, scalability, and
    reproducibility, benefiting the entire research institution.
