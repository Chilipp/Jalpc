  desc: A global weather generator for daily data
  long_desc: |
    This synthesis of FORTRAN and Python is a globally applicable weather
    generator parameterized through a global dataset of weather station data with
    more than 50 million individual daily records. It downscales wind speed,
    precipitation, temperature, and cloud cover from monthly to daily resolution.

  desc: A model to simulate urban growth and transformation with the objective of minimising the energy required for transportation.
  long_desc: |
    The Integrated Urban Complexity model (IUCm) is a relatively simple
    probablistic computational model to compute “climate-smart urban forms”,
    that cut down emissions related to energy consumption from urban mobility.
