    Python is my main programming language that I use for almost everything on the computer. For the post processing of climate model data I am using <a href="http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/">xarray</a> and <a href="http://docs.dask.org/en/latest/">dask</a>, libraries for multi-dimensional datasets that support out-of-core computing. Other types of data are mainly analysed with <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>, <a href="https://www.numpy.org/">numpy</a> and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">scikit-learn</a>. Additionally I have expert knowledge about the <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> package that I use for visualizations and the <a href="https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro">PyQt</a> package that I use for the development of graphical user interfaces.
    <br>
    Most of my time, I spend with the development of new python software for climate analysis. During my PhD I worked on <a href="https://psyplot.github.io">psyplot</a>, it's <a href="https://psyplot.github.io/psyplot/plugins.html">plugins</a> and <a href="https://straditize.readthedocs.io">straditize</a>,
    and several small python packages mostly targeting other python developers that I published via <a href="https://pypi.org/user/Chilipp/" target="_blank">PyPi</a> and <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Chilipp+in%3Areadme" target="_blank">anaconda (via conda-forge)</a>.

    Finally, to communicate my data analysis to my colleagues, I am using jupyter notebooks from which I then often interface into other languages,
    such as <a href="javascript:switch2desc('R')">R</a>, <a href="javascript:switch2desc('Matlab')">Matlab</a> or <a href="javascript:switch2desc('Postgres')">Postgres</a>. In the rare cases where I need more computational efficiency and cannot solve it with numpy, I also use <a href="https://cython.org/">Cython</a>.

    Since about 3 years I am additionally working a lot with web deployment via Django where I created <a href="https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/hcdc/django">small generic projects and frameworks for large community portals</a>.
- name: R

    I used R in the past for statistical analysis when Python is not good enough (or too complicated). This involves inverse modelling for climate reconstructions based on proxy data, e.g. through the <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rioja">rioja</a> package, but also for rotated principal component analysis that we use in the HORNET project.
- name: MATLAB

    Matlab was one of the first programming languages I learned during my master. I dropped the development with it in favor of the more flexibel open source languages <a href="javascript:switch2desc('Python')">Python</a> and <a href="javascript:switch2desc('R')">R</a>. However, I am still using it sometimes for collaborations with other scientists that only code in Matlab.
- name: FORTRAN

    Although many software developers roll their eyes when you start talking about FORTRAN, climate models are still based on this old but very efficient language. And as such, I started very soon to develop numerical computational models in FORTRAN. During my master I worked with the <a href="https://mpimet.mpg.de/en/science/models/mpi-esm/">Max-Planck-Institutes Earth-System-Model (MPI-ESM)</a>, a parallelized coupled model of atmosphere, ocean and land surface. I worked with the parallelization of the MPI-ESM via OpenMP, and I developed my own statistical weather generator <a href="https://github.com/ARVE-Research/gwgen_f90">GWGEN</a>.
- name: Bash
  percentage: 90
  desc: |
    I am using the terminal more than any other software, and as such I am constantly using Bash. Not so much in scripts, but rather interactively from the command line. Nevertheless I am also sometimes computing from the command line using, for example, Climate Data Operators (CDOs) or NetCDF Operators (NCOs).
- name: C/C++
  percentage: 30
  desc: I can read and write C and C++ but so far there were not so many possible applications for me to use it since all the HPC applications that I worked with are written in FORTRAN. But I am keen to improve my skills with these languages in the near future.

    In our pollen assemblage projects, namely the <a href="http://p3.snf.ch/project-169598" title="Holocene Climate Reconstruction for the Northern Hemisphere Extra-tropics">HORNET</a> and the <a href="https://EMPD2.github.io" title="Eurasian Modern Pollen Database">EMPD</a> projects, we are distributing the data as a relational postgres database. The EMPD-admin, the automated adminstration webapp for the EMPD, reads and writes to this postgres database and uses it as a test for new contributions whether the comply with the standards of the database.

    I am not a frontend web developper by training, but I nevertheless used HTML and Javascript several times to share my work with colleagues. The web interface of the EMPD, hosted at a href="https://EMPD2.github.io">EMPD2.github.io</a> is one example for it. Here I combine free services of Github and Heroku to create a web interface for collaborators into the EMPD.
- name: Kubernetes
  percentage: 80
  desc: |
    I developed a workflow to securely deploy multiple web applications at our new RedHat OpenShift Container Platform, from static websites to <a href="javascript:switch2desc('Java')">Java</a> and <a href="javascript:switch2desc('Python')">Python (Django)</a> applications.

    The workflow is based upon helm charts and cookiecutter templates for docker repositories. This framework allows the maximum of flexibility and still abstracts all the complex configuration options for Kubernetes to the templates.

    The software templates are published open-source at <a href="https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/hcdc/software-templates">the Helmholtz Codebase</a>.
- name: Java

    Although several applications that I have to maintain are based on Java, I would not describe myself as being a Java developer. I am much more into <a href="javascript:switch2desc('Python')">Python</a>.
